This paper aims to develop machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN), to accurately predict the time lag between the issuance of a building permit and the commencement of construction in Israel. The primary objective is to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the Central Bureau of Statistics' (CBS) current imputation methods for missing construction start dates, which are crucial for economic planning and policy formulation. By analyzing a dataset of new residential buildings, we investigate the relationship between various factors, such as building characteristics, geographical location, and government policies, and the duration of the construction initiation process. To find the best-fitting model, we compare SVM and NN using three different approaches: regression, multi-class, and ordinal classification. For each approach, we explore various parameter combinations, including the number of hidden layers, activation functions, and learning rates, and evaluate the models based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression or accuracy for classification tasks. Additionally, we address the common challenge of imbalanced data, which can lead to biased model performance, by employing techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and class-weighted loss functions. The results from these methods are presented in the Results section, showcasing the optimal models that improve the overall quality of construction statistics.
